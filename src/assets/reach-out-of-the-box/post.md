Reach Out of the Box was an unique fundraising event hosted by Mallya Aditi International in collaboration with HelpAge India. The event was centered around a carnival followed by a live concert featuring 5 of India's largest bands. All proceeds from the event went to the victims of the Uttarakhand flood in India.

## Setting the mood

The event was a nigh-time carnival followed by a concert. This evoked an atmosphere of bright lights, good music, popcorn + cotton candy, and great deal of fun!

## Leaving a mark

The logo for Reach Out of the Box had to evoke a sense of fun and joyousness: 'fun' owing to the chaotic, yet energetic atmosphere of the concert and carnival, and 'joy' owing to the charitable cause of the event which celebrated giving back to society.

Various iterations of the logo were created, ranging in use color, form and typography. However, the variants that came closest to capturing the essence of the event shared a few core components: the use of multiple bright colors coupled with bold typography.

These characteristics carried over to the final logo: the words Reach Out of the Box forming a perspective box shape with bright, colored beams of light pouring out of the 'box'. These beams of light emulated the lights at the concert and also symbolized the charitable and all-embracing nature of the event. The logo was made dynamic too, with the color of the light beams changing with respect to context, and in turn, making the logo more memorable.

## One ticket, please

The design for the tickets was kept minimal, especially with respect to the amount of information displayed: only the information most essential to the ticket holder was displayed. This provided a clear user-experience.

Having a cleaner design increased the amount of real-estate on the ticket. This informed the decision to create a vertical ticket which allowed for the logo to be displayed in all its glory, making it more of a souvenir. Additionally, The dynamic identity was enforced to create variants for the various levels of tickets that could be purchased.

## Out of the box

The posters were created in the same vein as the tickets, with a stark focus on the logo and the beams of light. This focus was intended to differentiate the poster from the background which would help in making it seem as though the beams of light were bursting through the poster and into the world, spreading joy and happiness.

## SWAG SWAG SWAG

The visual identity created for the event was applied to tickets, badges, t-shirst, social media pages and merchandise. While designing these items, the identity was completely embraced and let to it being incorporated in unique ways: the lanyards of the badges were designed to look like an extension of the light beams, while the t-shirts were designed to have the beams wrap around the back, creating a sleek, symmetrical design.
