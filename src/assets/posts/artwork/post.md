<p class="introduction">Exploring traditional art media enabled me to enhace my design skills. Through this process I gained a deeper understanding of core design concepts such as color, form, composition and lighting while simultaneously gaining an appreciation for the techniques and nuances of the various media. Over the course of my journey I delved into a range of artistic media such as poster paints, oil paints, oil pastels, watercolors, pencil shading and ink. The following is a collection of my favourite works. Some of these works were created using reference pieces. My intention is simply to showcase the  skills I developed by working in various media.</p>
