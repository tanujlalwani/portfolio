## Who is the _reader_?

The target audience for the The Aditi Wall are the students of Mallya Aditi between the grades 5 and 12. This set of teenagers is adept with using the internet and they share and comsume a large amount of media regularly. This is a general overview of the target demographic. To understand more about their preferences and habits in the context of reading and writing, a user survey was conducted.

### User Surveys

Data was collected and aggregated over 90 user surveys completed by students of Mallya Aditi. The following are the key insights obtained after analyzing the data:

## What are the _goals_?

The key takeaways from the user research informed the goals of the design process:

- Design a revival of the magazine that stays true to the original The Aditi Wall.
- Create a reading experience that is minimal and distraction free.
- Take into account the strain imposed by excessive screen-time (especially at night).
- Increase reader engagement by making content more interesting and relevant.

## How does the reader feel?

### Mood Boards

From the analysis of the user surveys, it was evident that there was a pain point of having to read articles on a bright white screen for extended periods of time. One of the solutions was an alternate dark theme for the website, which would be easier on the eyes. Hence mood boards were created for both themes, to get an idea of how the experience might be affected.

#### Light

With the light theme, the mood being created was that of sitting in your comfortable pyjamas with a good book, on a sunny day.

#### Dark

With the dark theme, the mood being created was that of an inviting silecne, with a splash of bright color.

## Personal Touch

Being a school magazine, The Aditi Wall would need to be uniquely associated with Mallya Aditi. The school campus' walls were adorned with a plethora of paintings - the most iconic being a student-painted mural depicting school life that streched across a wall right at the enterance of the school. This was the perfect piece for the magazine's landing page. Adapting it for the modern, the mural was re-interpreted in a minimalist style to suit the digital medium, while retaining its iconic look. The following are portions of the original vs. digitized murals:

## Where does the reader _go_?

### Wireframes

The layout of the website is quite simple with a template for the home page and another one for the article page. The home page had variants where the hero image would change based on the category being viewed. Each article page would have a full width hero banner, followed by centered text interspersed with medium or large size images. The images would have interactive captions either containing blockquotes or expanding on the content of the image in the context of the article, adding another mode of engagement for the reader.

### Style Guide

The mood boards and wireframes were used as the basis for the creation of the style guide. After dozens of variations of logos, typefaces, and colors, the following style was selected as it best represented The Aditi Wall brand: the best aspects of the light and dark themes were combined to form a minimal, yet bold aesthetic coupled with bright, attractive gradients.

## What does the reader _do_?

### Prototyping

One of the goals while designing prototypes was to give the reader as simple as an experience possible - every interaction had to be essential to enhancing the reader's experience. This resulted in the creation of the four key interactions seen below. Each interaction is as smooth as possible to prevent the reader's pulling the reader out of their flow. These interactions aim to replicate the physcial act of browsing a magazine.

## What does the reader _use_?

### Style Guide

The results of the design process from steps 1 - 6 built upon one another with tight feedback loops, resulting in the final design of the website. Following the design phase, I coded the website in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The task was challenging as every detail from the designs had to be a part of the website - from fonts, to animations and responsive design of the site. The completed result is presented below:
