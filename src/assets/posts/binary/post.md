<p class="introduction">This series is an exploration into the intersection of art and science, primarily typography and linear algebra. Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that delves into the math of linear equations. However, what fascinates me the most about this field is the connection between the math of these numeric, linear operations and their corresponding geometric operations.

## Process

The combination typography and motion graphics serves as the perfect medium for bringing to life these abstract concepts of linear algebra. Through this series, I experiment with 2D and 3D motion graphics to explore the field of linear algebra using funadmental core concepts while paying attention to detailed typography with respect repetition, contrast, herirachy, and spacing. Finally, the binary motif serves to provide consistency, as though emulating the invisible patterns of the digital world that surrounds us.

An excellent resource for gaining a deeper understanding of linear algebra is the course by 3Blue1Brown: The Essence of Linear Algebra.
